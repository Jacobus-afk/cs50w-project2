# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


## Requirements

Conforms to the following

* First time visitors are prompted for a display name, which will be remembered until the browser's history or the localStorage property is cleared. This means closing the browser and reopening the webpage will keep the user logged in

* Any user is able to create a new channel, provided the channel's name doesn't conflict with any other channels stored in the application's memory

* All created channels are listed in a dropdown box which can be selected and connected to

* Once a channel is selected previous activities (messages, users connecting/disconneting) will be displayed in the messages box. The server is able to store up to the 100 most recent activities for each channel. Restarting the server will however cause the channels' histories to be lost

* **Personal touch:** The project is also deployed on heroku at https://flak-jaket.herokuapp.com/
